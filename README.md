### Day ------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure $editor feature "goto-definition" works.  Need to be
able to see how some common functions are implemented.

in emacs this is bound to <M-.>, which pushes the previous location
onto a stack, which can be popped to go back with <M-,>

Make sure the editor can automatically tell you important type
information about the methods you're working with, such as parameter
types.

Work through Chapter 2 of the book.

### Day

Concurrency: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbytx0ivH7Q>
note: virtual dispatch is the same as dynamic dispatch.

-   Guard Type
-   channels
-   depends: Rc, Arc, Mutex, thread::spawn,
-   Rayon: easy
-   what is 6.005 doing?
-   MPMC, multiple producer multiple consumer

Futures: asynch I/O

-   highly concurrent

More on concurrency
<https://parallel-rust-cpp.github.io>

1.  What is virtual dispatch in rust?

    that's like c++ virtual table, is now called dynamic dispatch.

2.  Tokio: mio + futures

    -   mio cross platform interface
    -   oneshot channels
    -   mpsc channel?

## STRUCTURE

### PEDAGOGY

1.  Re-asking original questions from stack overflow, rust forum

    1.  What are the differences between Rust's \`String\` and \`str\`?
    
        <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24158114/what-are-the-differences-between-rusts-string-and-str/24159933#24159933>
    
    2.  How to enable/disable assertions in rust programs?
    
        <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert.html>
        Assertions are always checked in both debug and release builds, and
        cannot be disabled. See debug<sub>assert</sub>! for assertions that are not
        enabled in release builds by default.

2.  Incrementally Removing Functionality For Guided Projects

    So build a full project with lots of tests that work.  At this point
    the project is done with 100% test coverage.  On to the teaching part.
    
    Remove the body of a method which will cause tests to fail.
    commit this to a git repo.
    tag this commit as the <Nth> homework.
    tests will pass when the method has been reimplemented the method.
    
    Step 2.
    
    Comment out the failing tests. So the all remaining tests pass.
    Remove the body of another method which will cause tests to fail.
    commit this to a git repo.
    tag this commit as the <N-1)th> homework.
    tests will pass when the scholar has implemented the method.
    
    Goto Step 2.
    
    When each method has been commented out, then we're at the beginning
    of the project, with a clear and proven step by step path through the
    contruction of a program.  With the tests necessary 
    
    Stopping here would be good enough for people who want to learn, but
    since git history contains the implementation, it contains all the
    information needed to cheat. It would be easy enough to automate
    the checkout and wholesale copy of each commit along the way. Then
    students could upload solutions and get a keys to the next git commit.

3.  Borrow from 6.005 & 6.172

    1.  6.172 SPEED.
    
        -   Loop Fusion, jamming.
            <https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4232&v=H-1-X9bkop8>
        
        -   \[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]$$4
            cargo build &#x2013;release
            cargo asm my<sub>crate</sub>::my<sub>function</sub>

4.  APPROACH

    <https://github.com/ctjhoa/rust-learning>
    
    As for a "From first principles, please spare me the details" 15 week
    rust course?
    
    Principle of covering the parts that are strictly necessary and hard
    to learn to prevent grasping at straws.
    
    What would Staff do?  rapidly and clearly define abstractions by knowing how
    they work, getting practice and moving on to the next. Focusing early
    on what's important and only what's necessary to achieve the goal, the
    6.004x strategy for building a cpu and understanding how it works in
    15 weeks.
    
    Editor agnostic. Use what you want, but support varies by what people
    have figured out so far.
    
    assembling excellent pre-existing disparate material.  Overlap is
    ok. Licensing is problematic though.  Trim the overlap and give
    credit.
    
    -   N topics while minding fast&safe

            <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html>
            
            Drop trait. Are integers dropped?
            <https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=f074df3610670b5a0e1bc9a97856fd36>
    
    2.  Borrowing
    
    3.  Lifetimes
    
        what has a lifetime?
    
    4.  Data
    
        1.  Slices
        
        2.  Enum

        Indirection
        Modules
        Traits
        Closures

    6.  Testing as you go
    
        <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-04-testing-the-librarys-functionality.html>
    
    7.  each concept has 3 exercises
    
    8.  each exercise views the concept 3 ways

6.  General Programming concepts in rust

    Mutability
    Modules

7.  How deep to go on these data structures?

    Why not spend a whole day on each one? Learn how to study how the data
    structures work, then people will know how to learn how to study how
    other data structures work.

            1.  What is a box?
            
                uses global allocator
                <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html>
                A pointer type for heap allocation.
            
            2.  Smart Pointers
            
                1.  RC a reference counted type enabling multiple ownership
                
                2.  Arc
                
                    1.  <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html>
                    
                        The type Arc<T> provides shared ownership of a value of type T,
                        allocated in the heap. Invoking clone on Arc produces a new Arc
                        instance, which points to the same value on the heap as the source
                        Arc, while increasing a reference count. When the last Arc pointer to
                        a given value is destroyed, the pointed-to value is also destroyed.
                        
                        Shared references in Rust disallow mutation by default, and Arc is no
                        exception: you cannot generally obtain a mutable reference to
                        something inside an Arc. If you need to mutate through an Arc, use
                        Mutex, RwLock, or one of the Atomic types.

## Questions


<a id="org13a00e4"></a>

### Chapter7

1.  What's the difference between packages and crates?

    A crate is a binary or library
    
    A package is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A
    package contains a Cargo.toml file that describes how to build those
    crates.
    
    crates.io is an unfortunate name, should be packages.io.

2.  What's the deal with modules?

    1.  How do I, #include "./point.h"
    
        For programs with a main() function (i.e. not libraries)
        
        */ main.rs ------------&#x2013;&#x2014;
        mod point;  /* introduce the module declared in point.rs 
        
        use crate::point;
        
        fn main() {
            let p1 = Point::new(2, 4);
        }

3.  Chapter14

    1.  What's a workspace?
    
    2.  mod is overloaded, it can mean
    
        -   append a local module's path onto crate::
        -   declare a module
    
    3.  files without mod keyword implictity declare module.

## Objective

Lifetimes, dangling references. This page is important for learning.
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html>

The first half is going to be about safety. The second half will be
about profiling and when unsafe is the right way to go.


<a id="org45e35d0"></a>

## PERFORMANCE

let mut xs = Vec::with<sub>capacity</sub>(123); */ note: goto def and see how it's implemented.
xs.resize(123, 0) /* xs now contains 123 zeros.
replaces malloc dance
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html>


<a id="orgcc700a8"></a>

## Owned Types in structs.

<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#ownership-of-struct-data>
"In the User struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned
String type rather than the &str string slice type. This is a
deliberate choice because we want instances of this struct to own all
of its data and for that data to be valid for as long as the entire
struct is valid."

## Practical Stuff


<a id="orgbd51dcd"></a>

### Setting up Editor

<https://areweideyet.com>

1.  Rust Language Server

    <https://www.mortens.dev/blog/emacs-and-the-language-server-protocol/>


<a id="orge38d984"></a>

### Editor Considerations

1.  Editing rustdoc comments in emacs

    <https://boinkor.net/2018/10/editing-rustdoc-comments-in-emacs/>

2.  Editor editions

    It couldn't be taught in emacs, that's for sure.  An editor with
    shallow learning curve that covers the basics without being painful,
    that's a TODO: find good easy editor.  Then tackle the underlying
    theory, (like the boolean logic lecture), but maybe for scant type
    theory.  Just enough to hand wave around type features.  Jumping off
    points to the compilers course and getting people ready to port xv6 to
    Rust

3.  It's critical that the editor support works

    -   find definition is necessary to see how things work.
        convenient references when learning else no learning.

4.  Debugging

    <https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/09/21/office-hours-0-debugging-with-gdb/>
    
    "rr aspires to be your primary C/C++ debugging tool for Linux,
    replacing â well, enhancing â gdb. You record a failure once, then
    debug the recording, deterministically, as many times as you want. The
    same execution is replayed every time."
    <https://rr-project.org>

## ONLINE RUST COURSE BLUEPRINT


<a id="org852ae75"></a>

### Facets of Ownership

Explicate mechanics. What is rust doing automatically?  Using move
explicitly. Using move, replace, take, these common examples and the
exercise will be to slowly build up the automation.  Desugar
rust. Then Resugar it.


<a id="org0c75b0b"></a>

### Languages

<http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4389>


<a id="org55901f4"></a>

### Copy

1.  Shallow Copy

    Copy, does a shallow copy of the stack data, but maintains pointers to
    the same heap memory.
    Types with Drop trait implemented can't implement Copy.

2.  Clone (python's deep<sub>copy</sub>)


<a id="org1dfe9e4"></a>

### A rust implementation of the lambda-calculus?


<a id="org5b06879"></a>

### Scopes are owners.


<a id="orgc13812d"></a>

### Methodology

1.  motivate by introducing project. A gem to behold.

    The gem principle of course
    
    6.004 uses the beta as an artifact to contend with and build.
    SICP uses scheme in the same way.
    
    Students assemble a working minimal artifact by somewhere around the
    3/5 point. Then deep thought is required about modifying the
    artifact.
    
    The goal isnât to get people to the point where they can design and
    build the artifact from scratch, rather itâs to deliver the ability to
    use the tools and blueprints, to show them how to apply the tools to
    the blueprints. Get familiar with the blueprints.
    
    Introduce topics with top down wishful thinking to motivate.  Trace
    down to necessary implementation.  build bottom up just in time to
    maintain relevence.
    
    Omni projects, a ~1 KLOC project.

<a id="org453388d"></a>

### Philosophy

Take the most learningest of learning moments one would find while
porting a C code base that hits all the highlights and set those up
like golf tees, paint the scenes in between, then the next hole. (a
golf course analogy isn't bad, maybe cliche though, narratives in
courses, lord of the rings would work too, video games have these
arcs, why not learning?, final bosses, etc)

So, a VM to get things up and running quickly.  People can SSH into
the VM if they want.  Backups should be included though, so a script
to pack up $HOME for backup on host machine, along with a package
list, etc.

Tests are local on the VM, perhaps design tests so that careful
inspection will provide clues to the solution but not too many clues
:)

make sure it's obvious why the pain is worth the upfront type systems
hurdles.

    -

<a id="org37577d3"></a>

### What's an interface?

<https://www.callicoder.com/golang-interfaces/> 

//It's like an object but it can't be instantiated 

It's a list of method declarations grouped by commonality.  A type is
said to implement an interface if the interfaces methods are
implemented for the type.

It's like C++ Abstract Class
Haskell type class

            -   CONTEXT = When a new object is created, it is alloted a new context
                which is considered to be inside that ob ject, and whose contents
                are deemed to be owned by that ob ject. In the program text, this
                partition is denoted by rep, the partition which holds the
                representation roughly a scheme frame
            
            -   OWNERSHIP TYPES = static types annotated with context declarations
                that represent object ownership
            
            -   RESTRICTED VISIBILITY = a property which limits the extent of object
                visibility
            
            -   REPRESENTATION CONTAINMENT = property which provides a notion of
                containment based on articulation points

### Helping the cause

implement for loop names in racer?


<a id="orgaf26744"></a>

### NEW IDEAS?

1.  Restricted aliases

    Restrict the graph distance of an aliased item. So, an object may
    have field with type \*C, but it can't have a field with type \*B if B
    has a field with type \*C ?  


<a id="orged10f57"></a>

### Scheme Segque

Implement lifetime observers in the basic scheme interpreter.
set! needs to be rethought.
when frames are removed from the environment lifetimes end
etc.


<a id="orgda65556"></a>

### TOOLS

Pick an editor with good rust support. If you hit a snag then open an
issue so other people can learn.
